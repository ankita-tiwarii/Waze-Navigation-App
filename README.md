Churn Rate Prediction & Reduction for Waze

This project focuses on predicting and reducing user churn for Waze, a navigation application. Churn prediction enables the identification of users who are likely to stop using the app, while targeted insights help reduce churn through data-driven strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Built a machine learning model to predict churn probability of Waze users.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify behavioral and usage patterns leading to churn.

Applied feature engineering & statistical testing to uncover the top drivers of churn.

Designed predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify churners vs. retained users.

Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Data Preprocessing â€“ cleaned and transformed user activity logs for modeling.

Predictive Modeling â€“ trained and compared multiple ML algorithms.

Churn Reduction Strategies â€“ provided actionable insights to help Waze reduce churn by:

Improving user engagement through feature personalization.

Re-engaging at-risk users with targeted notifications.

Enhancing app experience to increase daily active usage.

ðŸ“Š Outcomes

Reduced churn rate by identifying the top 3 behavioral factors responsible for ~70% of churn.

Delivered a robust prediction model to target at-risk users with personalized retention campaigns.

Empowered Wazeâ€™s product and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions for user retention.
